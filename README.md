Comparing the effect of adjustment of labelset capacity of the LabelRank
algorithm for community detection.

[LabelRank] is an algorithm for **detecting communities in graphs**. *Community*
*detection* helps us understand the *natural divisions in a network* in an
**unsupervised manner**. It is used in **e-commerce** for *customer*
*segmentation* and *advertising*, in **communication networks** for *multicast*
*routing* and setting up of *mobile networks*, and in **healthcare** for
*epidemic causality*, setting up *health programmes*, and *fraud detection* is
hospitals. *Community detection* is an **NP-hard** problem, but heuristics exist
to solve it (such as this). *LabelRank* is an **iterative algorithm** that is
based on the concept of *propagation of weighted labels* on a *weighted*
*(directed) network*, where the highest weight label determines the *community*
*membership* of each vertex.

Our implementation of LabelRank **differs** from the original algorithm in that
there is a *fixed upper limit* on the *number of labels per vertex* (**labelset**
**capacity**). Therefore we do not use the *cutoff operator* (which removes
low-weighted labels), but instead trim-off labels if they do not fit within
labelset capacity. *Labels* are **sorted by weight** such that only low-weighted
labels are eliminated.

In this experiment the **labelset capacity** is **adjusted from 1 to 16** (in
multiples of 2), and the LabelRank algorithm is performed (5 times for
averaging). We run the algorithm for exactly `10 iterations` with the following
parameters: `inflation=1.5`, `conditionalUpdate=0.5`. We measure the **time**
**taken** for the *computation*, and *measure* the **modularity score** (one of
the ways to measure quality of communities). This is repeated for *seventeen*
other graphs.

From the results, we note that using a **labelset capacity of 1** yields not
only the **best performance** (as expected), but also ends up providing us with
the **highest modularity score**. The only exception is on the
`soc-LiveJournal1` where a labelset capacity of 4 yields and slightly higher
modularity compared to that with a labelset capacity of 1. If this holds for
other parameter values as well, it would indicate that **cheapest is also the**
**best**.

All outputs are saved in a [gist] and a small part of the output is listed here.
Some [charts] are also included below, generated from [sheets]. The input data
used for this experiment is available from the [SuiteSparse Matrix Collection].
This experiment was done with guidance from [Prof. Kishore Kothapalli] and
[Prof. Dip Sankar Banerjee].
